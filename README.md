### Node Welcome Script for My Arch!

Just messing around with node and linux in general, trying to create a script that greets me and also shows me a interesting quote, whenever I login to Hyprland

## Installation
First, install this globally with
```
npm install -g namaskar-script
```
and then in your Hyprland configuration. execute the script once in login with

```bash 
exec-once=namaskar
```
Also, make sure to create a assets folder in your home directory and also provide the API key in your environmental variables.

## Feedbacks
This is my personal script, make changes as necessary and use. Open to cool PRs too!
